This project uses several forms of testing to make sure the Hangman game works correctly and is enjoyable to play. Unit testing checks individual functions like creating the game and detecting win or loss conditions, which helps catch logic errors early. Input validation testing ensures players can only enter valid letters, preventing crashes or unexpected behavior. Integration and manual testing confirm that all parts of the game work smoothly together and that the gameplay experience feels clear and fair. Using these testing methods together makes the program more reliable, stable, and user-friendly.
