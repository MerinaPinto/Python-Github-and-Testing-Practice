What Went Well: The game is organized into clear functions, which makes the code easy to read and maintain. Input validation ensures that players only enter single letters, preventing errors during gameplay. The ASCII art hangman adds a fun visual element, and the replay option makes it easy for players to start a new game. Allowing players to choose a category adds variety and makes the game more interactive.

What went wrong: The game could sometimes be confusing for players, especially as they progress or try again, because the different sections of the game, like the hangman drawing, guessed letters, and word display, appear very close together on the screen. This can make it hard to quickly see which letters were guessed and how the word is being built. Another challenge was the logic for updating the word as correct letters were guessed.


What I Would Do With More Time I would expand the word bank and add more categories or even use an external file for words. I could improve the interface with colors to make it more visually appealing. Adding a scoring system or hints could make the game more engaging and challenging. These changes would make the game more fun and interactive for players.
